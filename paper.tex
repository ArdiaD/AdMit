\section*{Summary}

AdMit is an R package \citep{R} which provides flexible functions to approximate
a certain target distribution and to efficiently generate a sample of random draws from it, 
given only a kernel of the target density function. 
The core algorithm fits an adaptive mixture
of Student-t distributions to the density of interest, and then, importance sampling
or the independence chain Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to obtain quantities of interest for
the target density, using the fitted mixture as the importance or candidate density. 
The estimation procedure is fully automatic and thus avoids the time-consuming and
difficult task of tuning a sampling algorithm. Full description of the algorithm
and numerous application are available in \citet{ArdiaEtAl2009a} and \citet{ArdiaEtAl2009b}.
The latest version of the package is available at \url{https://github.com/ArdiaD/AdMit}.
