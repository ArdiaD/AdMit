Description: Provides functions to perform the fitting of an
  adaptive mixture of Student-t distributions to a target density through its kernel function.
  The mixture approximation can then be used as the importance density
  in importance sampling or as the candidate density in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to
  obtain quantities of interest for the target density itself.
